<left-text>I am an architectural and landscape designer based in New York. My work explores the relationship between architectural technology and cross-species encounter, understanding, and co-evolution. Drawing from knowledge and insights in the history of science, I search for reciprocity between ecological, sexual, and digital politics in architecture.</left-text>
<left-text>I have worked on projects in New York, Paris, and China with offices including MOS Architects, Francois Roche/New-Territories, and Ken Smith Workshop. My built projects include a garden at the Jardin de Metis in Quebec (2025), a traveling garden installed at Syracuse University School of Architecture (2025), and a shed for a queer bar in Brooklyn, New York (2023).</left-text>
<left-text>I hold a Bachelor of Landscape Architecture with honors from the Pennsylvania State University, and a Master of Architecture from Columbia University Graduate School of Architecture, Planning and Preservation, where I received the Excellence in Design award, a William Kinne Fellowship, and the AIA Allwork Scholarship. I teach architecture and media at Syracuse University School of Architecture.</left-text>
